Sources: MidiSynth version 1.7 for Haiku
========================================

Here are the source files for the Haiku version
of Michael Pfeiffer's old BeOS app.

The included Makefile is a slightly modified
standard Haiku makefile that I typically use,
which references external "Makefile.SRCS" and
"Makefile.RSRCS" specification files.

"MAKE" is a xicon script to run the make with
a mouse-click, but you can equally well type
"make" in a terminal.

Michael's original x86 '.proj' file is also
included, but I don't know whether it's applicable
to Haiku.

The "Keyboard3D..." files were not compiled in
the BeOS version, and code referencing them was/is
commented out.  I haven't tried them, but if you
feel experimental...

For the Haiku version changes, see 'Release.txt'
in the parent folder.
