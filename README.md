# MidiSynth

A simple software MIDI keyboard using Haiku's built-in synthesizer.

It can be played with the mouse and/or the computer's keyboard, and also has an
interface (In and Out) to MIDI hardware and any apps that use MidiKit2.

The Haiku synthesizer can be disabled and the used soundfont can be specified.

You can select the MIDI channel to be used, and which GM instrument a patch 
should sound. Velocity, Pan, and Pitchbend MIDI parameters are adjusted with
sliders, as well as the synth output volume,

MidiSynth supports chords, which are defined in a file and can be enabled by 
selecting a chord from a the Chords menu.
